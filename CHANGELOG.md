# Changelog

## [0.1.3] - 2025-06-08

### Note on Versioning

The version history was revised for clarity and better alignment with semantic versioning.  
Previously, versions were in the `0.0.x` range. These have been renumbered to `0.1.x` as follows:

| Old Version | New Version |
|-------------|-------------|
| 0.0.1       | 0.1.0       |
| 0.0.2       | 0.1.1       |
| 0.0.3       | 0.1.2       |
| 0.0.4       | 0.1.3       |

This changelog uses the updated numbering from this point forward.
